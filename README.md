An implementation of the [IETF Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks)
end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocol.

## What is MLS?

MLS is a new IETF end-to-end encryption standard that is designed to
provide transport agnostic, asynchronous, and highly performant
communication between a group of clients.

## MLS Protocol Features

- Multi-party E2EE [group evolution](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#name-cryptographic-state-and-evo)
  via a propose-then-commit mechanism.
- Asynchronous by design with pre-computed [key packages](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#name-key-packages),
  allowing members to be added to a group while offline.
- Customizable credential system with built in support for X.509 certificates.
- [Extension system](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#name-extensions)
  allowing for application specific data to be negotiated via the protocol.
- Strong forward secrecy and post compromise security.
- Crypto agility via support for multiple [ciphersuites](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#name-mls-ciphersuites).
- Pre-shared key support.
- Subgroup branching.
- Group reinitialization (ex: protocol version upgrade).

## Features

- Easy to use client interface that manages multiple MLS identities and groups.
- 100% RFC conformance with support for all default credential, proposal,
  and extension types.
- Async API with async trait based extension points.
- Configurable storage for key packages, secrets and group state
  via provider traits along with default "in memory" implementations.
- Support for custom user created proposal, and extension types.
- Ability to create user defined credentials with custom validation
  routines that can bridge to existing credential schemes.
- OpenSSL and Rust Crypto based ciphersuite implementations.
- Crypto agility with support for user defined ciphersuites.
- High test coverage including security focused tests and
  pre-computed test vectors.
- Fuzz testing suite.
- Benchmarks for core functionality.
